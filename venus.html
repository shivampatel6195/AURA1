          Venus, often referred to as Earth's sister planet, is the second
          planet from the Sun. It is similar in size, mass, and composition to
          Earth, but its environment is vastly different. Venus has an
          incredibly thick atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide, with
          clouds of sulfuric acid, making it the hottest planet in the solar
          system with surface temperatures reaching up to 465°C (870°F).
          <br /><br />
          Unlike most planets, Venus rotates in the opposite direction to its
          orbit, meaning that the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east. A
          day on Venus (one rotation) is longer than a year, taking about 243
          Earth days to rotate once but only 225 days to orbit the Sun.
          <br /><br />
          Despite its scorching heat, Venus has been a target of numerous
          missions. The Soviet Union’s Venera missions in the 1960s and 1970s
          provided the first close-up images of Venus' surface. In recent years,
          missions like NASA's Parker Solar Probe have provided new insights
          into Venus' atmosphere and magnetic field.
