          Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known celestial body to harbor life. 
          It has a diverse range of ecosystems, including forests, oceans, deserts, and polar ice caps. 
          With its dense atmosphere primarily composed of nitrogen and oxygen, Earth is able to support 
          a variety of life forms.
          <br /><br />
          The planet's surface is 71% water, with the remaining 29% covered by continents and islands. 
          Earth's climate is affected by its axial tilt, leading to the changing of seasons throughout the year.
          <br /><br />
          Earth's distance from the Sun is about 150 million kilometers (93 million miles), making it perfectly 
          placed to support life through its mild climate and liquid water. It takes Earth 365.25 days to complete 
          one orbit around the Sun, giving us our year. Earth rotates on its axis every 24 hours, giving us day and night.
          <br /><br />
          The planet's unique biodiversity and complex ecosystems make Earth a vibrant and ever-changing world, 
          with various natural phenomena like earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and weather patterns that influence its surface.
