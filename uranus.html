          Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is classified as an ice giant due to its composition of water, methane, and ammonia ice. 
          It is unique among the planets because it rotates on its side, possibly due to a collision with another celestial body in its early history.
          <br /><br />
          Uranus has a faint ring system and 27 known moons, with the largest being Titania and Oberon. The planet has a blue-green hue, 
          which is a result of methane gas in its atmosphere that absorbs red light.
          <br /><br />
          Uranus takes 84 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun, and its tilted axis causes extreme seasonal variations. 
          The planet experiences long periods of daylight and darkness, depending on which hemisphere is facing the Sun.
          <br /><br />
          NASAâ€™s Voyager 2 spacecraft provided the most detailed observations of Uranus during its flyby in 1986, capturing images of its atmosphere, 
          rings, and moons. Uranus remains a mystery, but future missions may provide more insight into its unique characteristics.
