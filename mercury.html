          Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and is closest to
          the Sun. Despite its small size, Mercury has a big story to tell, with
          an extreme climate and a surface marked by craters and high cliffs.
          This planet is unique in its lack of atmosphere, leading to extreme
          temperature variations. Temperatures can soar to 430°C (800°F) during
          the day and plummet to -180°C (-290°F) at night.
          <br /><br />
          Mercury's orbit is elliptical, and its distance from the Sun varies
          from 46 million kilometers (29 million miles) at its closest to 70
          million kilometers (43 million miles) at its farthest. This proximity
          makes it challenging for scientists to observe it, as the Sun's glare
          often overwhelms its appearance in telescopes. However, missions such
          as NASA's MESSENGER have provided valuable insights.
          <br /><br />
          With its incredibly long day and short year—Mercury takes 59 Earth
          days to rotate once but only 88 days to orbit the Sun—it presents a
          fascinating contrast to our home planet.
