          Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, a gas giant composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. 
          It has a diameter of about 142,984 kilometers (88,846 miles) and is famous for its swirling clouds, 
          immense size, and the Great Red Spot—a giant storm that has raged for at least 350 years.
          <br /><br />
          Jupiter has more than 75 moons, including Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system. The planet 
          also has a faint ring system, though it is much less prominent than that of Saturn. 
          <br /><br />
          Jupiter takes about 12 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun, and its rapid rotation—completing 
          a day in just under 10 hours—causes strong winds and turbulent weather patterns. The planet's thick 
          atmosphere and strong magnetic field make it an inhospitable environment for human exploration, 
          but it remains a key object of study for scientists.
          <br /><br />
          NASA’s Juno mission is currently orbiting Jupiter, studying its atmosphere, magnetic field, and interior 
          structure. The insights gathered from Juno and other missions will help us better understand the gas giant 
          and its role in the formation of the solar system.
