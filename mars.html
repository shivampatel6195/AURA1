          Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is often referred to as the "Red Planet" because of its reddish appearance, 
          due to iron oxide (rust) on its surface. It is a cold desert world with polar ice caps, deep valleys, and the 
          largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons.
          <br /><br />
          Despite its harsh conditions, Mars has been a prime target for exploration because of its potential to harbor 
          life in the past. Scientists believe that liquid water once flowed on Mars, and evidence of water-ice beneath 
          its surface continues to excite researchers. Mars is home to many rovers and landers, including NASAâ€™s Perseverance 
          and Curiosity, which are studying the planet's geology and climate.
          <br /><br />
          Mars takes about 687 Earth days to complete one orbit around the Sun. It has seasons like Earth due to its axial 
          tilt, but they last about twice as long because of its longer year. The planet's atmosphere is thin and made 
          mostly of carbon dioxide, making it unbreathable for humans without assistance.
          <br /><br />
          Future missions to Mars, including human exploration, are being planned as we look towards understanding the Red 
          Planet better and perhaps one day establishing a human presence there.
