          Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. It is classified as an ice giant, 
          and its striking blue color is due to the absorption of red light by methane in its atmosphere. Neptune’s atmosphere 
          is incredibly dynamic, with the fastest winds recorded in the solar system, reaching speeds of up to 2,100 kilometers 
          (1,300 miles) per hour.
          <br /><br />
          Neptune has a faint ring system and 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest. Triton is unique due to its 
          retrograde orbit, meaning it orbits Neptune in the opposite direction of the planet’s rotation. Triton is thought to 
          be a captured object from the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune.
          <br /><br />
          Neptune takes about 165 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun. The planet experiences intense storms, 
          with its most notable being the Great Dark Spot, a massive storm comparable to Jupiter’s Great Red Spot.
          <br /><br />
          NASA’s Voyager 2 spacecraft is the only mission to have visited Neptune, flying by in 1989. Voyager 2’s observations 
          provided the first close-up images of Neptune and its moons, but much about the planet remains unknown, awaiting 
          further exploration in the future.
